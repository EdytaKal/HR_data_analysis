# HR_data_analysis
Hiring new people takes a lot of time and resources. That is why it is important to identify the profile of a good employee and recognise how they have been found. 
Another thing useful to know is the profile of people most likely to quit. By recognising this, the employee can then think of ways of attracting the potentially 
quitting employees in staying in the company.

Today I will be addressing that problem by answering the following questions in my analysis:
- what is the profile of the most successful employee for the company so far (including the rough age range, gender, marital status, and which state they live in)?
- what is the profile of the most likely to quit employee (including age, marital status, and how long they have worked for the company)?

I am using the following dataset for my analysis:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidepolizzi/hr-data-set-based-on-human-resources-data-set.

There are the following data available in that dataset:
- gender
- marital status
- position
- living in a state 
- age
- citizenship
- whether they are Hispanic or not
- how long have they been working in a company

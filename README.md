# Employment Data Analysis For A Mid-size US Company 
## Project background
The company whose dataset is analysed in this project is a US engineering company that started in 2006 and has around 2000 active employees. I am partnering with the Head of Human Resources to extract insights and deliver recommendations to attract hard-working, new employees and to ensure that the current employees are kept satisfied and that they stay in the company.

I will be running the analysis using an HR dataset from 2006-2018 for a USA company with around 2000 employees (view the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidepolizzi/hr-data-set-based-on-human-resources-data-set)).

All of the graphs used in this project can be found in an interactive Tableau dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/edi.kal/viz/HR_dataset2/Dashboard1#1).

## Executive Summary 
The company generally has a good reputation among their employees, resulting in many referrals. The least employees bring website banner ads and social media. This could mean that the company could stop advertising their job openings via website banners and instead spend resources on having a dedicated employee to deal with posts on Facebook and Twitter.

A high number of employees quit after working in the company for 6-9 years because of feeling unhappy. To avoid that the company should pay particular attention to such employees and provide them with positions to progress into within the company, salary rises and training opportunities. The company should also focus on providing their employees with regular mental support and openly support them in taking time off to take care of their mental health which could then lower the number of employees leaving the company because of feeling unhappy.

## Insights Deep-Dive
### Length of employment before an employee terminates their hire.
A quite high number of people quitting is from being a company for 6 up to 9 years. 
The highest rate of people leaving is after 9 years of working in a company- 344.
After 10 years of employment, the quitting rate is low- from 96 to 11 employees quitting after 14 years.

Employee satisfaction doesn't seem to be a main factor when it comes to employees quitting. 
Only 4 employees weren't satisfied with their work (giving a score of 2), while 490 
were highly satisfied with their work (giving a score of 4 to 5).

Approximately 700 employees who quit were fully meeting or exceeding the expectations. 
Only around 32 needed improvement.

### The most often reason why employees have left the company:
- feeling unhappy- 161
- wanting more money- 119

There are a couple of termination reasons that the company could take action to prevent employees from quitting, 
such as:
- medical issues, 
- more money, 
- maternity leave-did not return
- unhappy
For medical issues, the company could have a better support system, be more flexible with the employee 
having to see doctors and stay in hospitals.

Some mothers leave after giving birth. Companies could prevent that by allowing new parents to be flexible with work, allowing them to leave work to pick up their kids from school or stay at home if the kid is ill.


### The most effective recruitment sources that the company has control over:
- diversity job fair- 23 employed
- via the monster.com website- 15 employed
  
Quite a few people are getting employed by referral or via word of mouth, which can suggest
that people are generally happy with the company to refer people in.


## Recommendations
### Preventing employees from leaving
- **Create development opportunities**: Pay particular attention to employees working for 6-9 years in a company,
offering them and others positions to progress into and training opportunities so that they can further advance their skills and make further progress in their career.
- **Put in place regular salary increments**: Review if you have a plan for a regular increase of the salary of employees so that they feel appreciated and to stop them from leaving when seeking better pay.
- **Provide mental support in your workplace**: Make sure that your employees have regular mental support at work and openly support the employees taking time off to take care of their mental health.

### Successful resources for bringing new employees in
- **Stop using website banner ads**: Move away from advertising the job openings via website banners and instead spend the freed-up resources elsewhere.
- **Work on the company's presence on social media**: Look into having a dedicated employee to deal with posts on Facebook and Twitter.





THE BELOW MIGHT NOT BE NEEDED:
Hiring new people takes a lot of effort and resources. That is why it is important to answer the following questions:

*1) After how many years of working in a company is the employee most likely to quit and what are their reasons behind it?*
   
   Understanding when an employee is most likely to quit and why could allow the employee to address those reasons to prevent valuable employees from leaving the company. That would then effectively save the company's resources which would have to be spent when looking for their replacement.

*2) Which recruitment source has been the most effective when hiring employees fully meeting or exceeding the managers' expectations?*

   Identifying which recruitment resources have been the most effective in finding well-performing employees will allow HR to pay particular attention to them when looking for new employees.

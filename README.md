# Employement Data Analysis For A Mid-size USA Company 
## Intro
Hiring new people takes a lot of effort and resources. That is why it is important to answer the following questions:

*1) After how many years of working in a company is the employee most likely to quit and what are their reasons behind it?*
   
   Understanding when an employee is most likely to quit and why could allow the employee to address those reasons to prevent valuable employees from leaving the company. That would then effectively save the company's resources which would have to be spent when looking for their replacement.

*2) Which recruitment source has been the most effective when hiring employees fully meeting or exceeding the managers' expectations?* 

   Identifying which recruitment resources have been the most effective in finding well-performing employees will allow HR to pay particular attention to them when looking for new employees.

I will be answering these questions using an HR dataset from 2006-2018 for a USA company with around 2000 employees (view the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidepolizzi/hr-data-set-based-on-human-resources-data-set)).

## Metrics and Dimensions

**Reason for Termination**

**Recruitment Source**

**Performance Score**

## 1) After how many years of working in a company is the employee most likely to quit and what are their reasons behind it?*

### Length of employment before an employee terminates their hire.
The highest rate of people leaving is after 9 years of working in a company- 344.
After 10 years the quitting rate is really low from 96 to 11 employees quitting after 14 years.
A quite high number of people quitting is from being a company for 6 up to 9 years. 

Employee satisfaction doesn't seem to be a main factor when it comes to employees quitting. 
Only 4 employees weren't satisfied with their work (giving a score of 2), while 490 
were highly satisfied with their work (giving a score of 4 to 5).

Approximately 700 employees who quit were fully meeting or exceeding the expectations. 
Only around 32 needed improvement.

### The most often reason why employees have left the company:
- feeling unhappy- 161
- wanting more money- 119

There are a couple of termination reasons that the company could take action to prevent employees from quitting, 
such as:
- medical issues, 
- more money, 
- maternity leave-did not return
- unhappy
For medical issues, the company could have a better support system, be more flexible with the employee 
having to see doctors and stay in hospitals.

Some mothers leave after giving birth. Companies could prevent that by allowing new parents to be 
flexible with work, allowing leaving work to pick up their kids from school or stay at home if the kid is ill.

## Recommendations and Next Steps
- The company should pay particular attention to employees working for 6-9 years in a company,
offering them positions to progress into, salary rises and training opportunities.
- The company should review if they regularly increase the salary of hard-working employees.
- To prevent employees from leaving because of feeling unhappy the company could provide their employees
a regular mental support and openly support the employees taking time off to take care of their mental health.

## *2) Which recruitment source has been the most effective when hiring employees fully meeting or exceeding the managers' expectations?*
### The most effective recruitment sources that the company has control over:
- diversity job fair- 23 employed
- via the monster.com website- 15 employed
  
Quite a few people are getting employed by referral or via word of mouth, which can suggest
that people are generally happy with the company to refer people in.

## Recommendations and Next Steps
- The least employees bring website banner ads and social media. This could mean that the company could stop advertising their job openings via website banners and instead spend it elsewhere.
- The company could pay more attention to their presence in social networking media and look into having a dedicated employee to deal with posts on Facebook and Twitter.
